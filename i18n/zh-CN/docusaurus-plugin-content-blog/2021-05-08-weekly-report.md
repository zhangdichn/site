Hello everyone, here is the weekly report for [BeyondStorage](https://beyondstorage.io), range from 2021-05-06 to 2021-05-08.

Due to the [International Workers' Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Workers%27_Day), we only have three workdays this week. However, we still made lots of effort and managed to get some results. However, we still made lots of effort and managed to get some results.

## 库

### Appender 支持

`Appender` 被用于将内容附加到文件尾部。

This week, [@JinnyYi][] finished implement appender support in [Implement Appender Support](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage/issues/529). Great work! Great work!

### Idempotent Storager Delete Operation

We use `Delete` to handle all object delete operations, but their behavior is not unified and well-defined.

So [@Xuanwo][] made a proposal: [GSP-46: Idempotent Storager Delete Operation](https://github.com/beyondstorage/specs/blob/master/rfcs/46-idempotent-delete.md) for this, and [@JinnyYi][] is now leading the implementation.

For more details, please refer to [Implement GSP-46: Idempotent Storager Delete Operation](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage/issues/554).

### Additional Error Specification

In this week, [@xxchan][] has finished his first proposal: [GSP-47: Additional Error Specification](https://github.com/beyondstorage/specs/blob/master/rfcs/47-additional-error-specification.md) in our team! Congratulations! Congratulations!

After a study of our existing implementations in different services, [@xxchan][] did a great job for this proposal, which is designed to offer users unified experience when handle errors with [go-storage][].

For more details, please refer to [Implement GSP-47: Additional Error Specification](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage/issues/558).

### Service Registry Support

For now, every service implement the function like:

```go
func New(pairs ...typ.Pair) (typ.Servicer, typ.Storager, error) {}
func NewServicer(ps ...types.Pair) (types.Servicer, error) {}
func NewStorager(ps ...types.Pair) (types.Storager, error) {}
```

Users need to handle types by themselves.

So [@Xuanwo][] made a proposal: [GSP-48: Service Registry](https://github.com/beyondstorage/specs/blob/master/rfcs/48-service-registry.md) to refactor the functions which make it easier to init a `Storager`.

The proposal is still a draft and not implemented yet.

### Add CreateDir Operation

Applications need the ability to create a directory, and for now we did not offer a unified way to handle this.

So [@Xuanwo][] made a proposal: [GSP-49: Add CreateDir Operation](https://github.com/beyondstorage/specs/blob/master/rfcs/49-add-create-dir-operation.md) to allow user create a directory in the same way.

The [`Direr` interface](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage/blob/master/types/operation.generated.go#L166) has been added in [go-storage][], and more implementations in different services is now **help wanted**. You are welcome to make your own PR for this. You are welcome to make your own PR for this.

For more details, please refer to [Implement GSP-49 Add CreateDir Operation](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage/issues/560).
