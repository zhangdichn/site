### New UI Design

This week we have finalised the new UI design, including the main colours and page styles.

Thanks for our designer, check the [draft](https://www.figma.com/file/xSri76AIgzMUA3Gxs11GO0/Data-Migration-UI-Design?node-id=4%3A180) and feel free to express your idea or advice.

### Go-storage v4.1.0 Released

The new version v4.1.0 of [go-storage][] was [released](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage/releases/tag/v4.1.0) at 2021-06-08, in which we:
```
Added:
    cmd/definitions: Implement GSP-87 Feature Gates (#586)
    cmd/definitions: Implement GSP-93 Add ObjectMode Pair (#592)
Fixed:
    cmd/definitions: Fix storage features not generated (#588)
```

For more, we introduced our project to developers at this Wednesday, here is [the slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13Wm4d4OqO0WJ9Y0ZZ7NsjvfLqDilSkGX94qc1e7w87k/edit#slide=id.p).

### Add ObjectMode Pair

We have introduced `ObjectMode` in [GSP-25: Object Mode](https://github.com/beyondstorage/specs/blob/master/rfcs/25-object-mode.md):

```go
type ObjectMode uint32

const (
    ModeIrregular ObjectMode = 0
    ModeDir ObjectMode = 1 << iota
    ModeRead
    ModeLink
)
```

But it's not enough, we need `ObjectMode` pair too. For example, the `Create` operation needs `ObjectMode` to create a new object. And `ObjectMode` COULD be used as input restriction for operations. For example, the `Create` operation needs `ObjectMode` to create a new object. And `ObjectMode` COULD be used as input restriction for operations.

For example: In services like s3 which doesn't have native `CreateDir` support, we usually simulated it via creating an object that ends with `/`. But the behavior doesn't work in `Stat` and `Delete`. But the behavior doesn't work in `Stat` and `Delete`.

  - If user call `Stat("test")` after `CreateDir("test")`, he will get `ObjectNotExist` error.
  - If user call `Delete("test")` after `CreateDir("test")`, no object will be removed and `test/` will be kept in service.

So [@xuanwo][] made this proposal: [GSP-93: Add ObjectMode Pair](https://github.com/beyondstorage/specs/blob/master/rfcs/93-add-object-mode-pair.md) to add the `ObjectMode` pair, and this pair COULD be used in the following operations:

  - `Create`: set the output object's `ObjectMode`
  - `Stat`: ObjectMode hint, returns error if `ObjectMode` not meet.
  - `Delete`: ObjectMode hint

For `Stat` and `Delete`

  - Service SHOULD use the `ObjectMode` pair as a hint.
  - Service could have different implementations for different `ObjectMode`.

Take `s3` as an example, we simulate `CreateDir` via creating object ends with `/`. Take `s3` as an example, we simulate `CreateDir` via creating object ends with `/`. `CreateDir("test")` will create an object `test/` in s3. And we can And we can

  - stat this object via `Stat("test", pairs.WithObjectMode(types.ObjectModeDir))`
  - delete this object via `Delete("test", pairs.WithObjectMode(types.ObjectModeDir))`

For more details, please refer to [Implement GSP-93: Add ObjectMode Pair](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage/issues/591).

### Add Maximum File Size for Storage Write

Depending on the size of the data you are uploading, services offer different options, like upload a file in a single operation, in parts, or through append operation.

We use `Write` to handle single write operation, and the size is not unlimited.

  - S3 alike storage services have 5GB limit for a single PUT operation.
  - azblob limited to 5000 MiB(<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/put-blob>).

If we upload a file with size out of limit in a single operation, we will get an error like `Request Entity Too Large` in azblob. Same with `copy`,`fetch`, etc. Same with `copy`,`fetch`, etc.

We should figure out the error before sending request to reduce the consumption of network resources.

So [@JinnyYi][] made this proposal [GSP-97: Add Maximum File Size for Storage Write](https://github.com/beyondstorage/specs/pull/97) to add maximum size restriction as service related metadata for storage operations.

This proposal is still a draft, and any comments are welcome.
