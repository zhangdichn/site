## 库

### Appender 支持

`Appender` 被用于将内容附加到文件尾部。

This week, we implement `Appender` for the services that support this feature. This week, we implement `Appender` for the services that support this feature. [CommitAppend](https://github.com/beyondstorage/specs/blob/master/rfcs/0-commit-append.md) is introduced to finish an append procedure as service like dropbox needs a `close` to mark this appends process has been finished.

### 服务器端加密支持

Server Side Encryption, a.k.a., SSE is a feature to encrypt data on server side, which is used by various applications.

 [@xxchan](https://github.com/xxchan) was responsible for completing the SSE support for the services this week, including [Implement SSE support](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage/issues/523), [SEE-S3 sample code](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage-example/blob/master/sse_s3.go) and related documents. [SSE blog](https://beyondstorage.io/blog/2021/04/27/sse) shows what is SSE and how to use SSE in [go-storage][].

### Error Handling

Expected errors are errors that implementer expected. Expected errors are errors that implementer expected. Those errors should be defined with enough comments and any changes to them should be documented.

[GSP-11](https://github.com/beyondstorage/specs/blob/master/rfcs/11-error-handling.md) has specified error handling, but our service is not strict with its requirements when implemented. [GSP-11](https://github.com/beyondstorage/specs/blob/master/rfcs/11-error-handling.md) has specified error handling, but our service is not strict with its requirements when implemented. To make error handling more user friendly, [@xxchan](https://github.com/xxchan) is leading the support in [Network/IO Error should be expected so that we can retry them](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage/issues/145).

### Make Delete idempotent

The current `delete` behavior should be different for fs and object storage services.

For dropbox alike storage services, delete a file that is uploading, such as `Appender` procedure unfinished, will returns an error, which is different with file system and object storage. So we need to unify the behavior. So we need to unify the behavior.

Please keep an eye on our track issue: [Make Delete idempotent](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage/issues/551).

## 应用

### dm

[dm][] is a data migration service and a long time effort.

To ensure that task recovery carried out according to the plan, even if it is interrupted for many times, [Prnyself](https://github.com/Prnyself) finished [Proposal: Add support for stop and resume task](https://hackmd.io/@lance-ren/BJM1e2fw_) this week and will start the demo.

Hi-Fi  of [dm][] is under designing. The [Hi-Fi prototype interaction](https://www.figma.com/proto/tZBW1fMDLlcdFpaHJYih9B/Data-Migration-Prototype?page-id=1060%3A51&node-id=1060%3A14951&viewport=3370%2C1130%2C0.125&scaling=min-zoom) is on trial and welcome feedback.

### 开源软件供应链点亮计划 - 暑期2021

[Open Source Promotion Plan](https://summer.iscas.ac.cn/), a.k.a., OSPP, encourage everyone to pay close attention to open source software and open source community, aiming to cultivate and explore more outstanding developers.

This week we applied to participate in OSPP - Summer 2021 and posed the subject . This week we applied to participate in OSPP - Summer 2021 and posed the subject . [@Xuanwo](https://github.com/Xuanwo), [@Prnyself](https://github.com/Prnyself) and [@xxchan](https://github.com/xxchan) will take part in the subject, and we will recruit contributors from student groups.
