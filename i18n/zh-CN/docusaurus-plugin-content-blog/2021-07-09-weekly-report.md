Hello everyone, here is the weekly report for [BeyondStorage][], range from 2021-07-05 to 2021-07-09.

## 应用

### BeyondTeleport

Several days ago, we submitted an issue on [rename the project dm](https://github.com/beyondstorage/beyond-tp/issues/97). [@Xuanwo][] proposed a name list, including: [@Xuanwo][] proposed a name list, including:

- byteport
- bytesync
- beyond data migration
- beyond migration

After a discussion, finally we choose to use `BeyondTP`:

- project name: `beyond-tp`
- normal name: `BeyondTP`
- complete name: `BeyondTeleport`

The implementation has already been finished by [Rename dm into beyondtp](https://github.com/beyondstorage/beyond-tp/pull/116), and for more details, please refer to <https://github.com/beyondstorage/beyond-tp/issues/97>.

## Proposal Updates

This week, we have the following proposal updates.

### DMP-110: Refactor Task Distribute

For now, we use for-loop to monitor task submitting, and then distribute the task into staffs. We need an elegant way to monitor task submitting. We need an elegant way to monitor task submitting.

So [@Prnyself][] proposed [DMP-110](https://github.com/beyondstorage/dm/pull/110) to refactor the process of task distribution in [beyond-tp][].

This proposal is still unimplemented, any opinions or ideas are welcome.

### Implement GSP-127: Add ServiceInternal and RequestThrottled Errors

[GSP-127](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage/blob/master/docs/rfcs/127-add-serviceinternel-and-requestthrottled-errors.md) intends to add two global error codes, `ErrServiceInternal` and `ErrRequestThrottled`, so that users can retry only them instead of all errors in HTTP-based services.

Now it is implemented by [@junaire][] by [services: Implement GSP-127: Add ServiceInternal and RequestThrottled Errors](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage/pull/616).

For more details, please refer to [Tracking Issue for GSP-127: Add ServiceInternel and RequestThrottled Errors](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage/issues/612).

### GSP-134: Write Behavior Consistency

[GSP-134](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage/blob/master/docs/rfcs/134-write-behavior-consistency.md) intends to keep write related operations' behavior consistency, by declare:

- All write operations SHOULD NOT return an error as the object exists.
- All successful write operations SHOULD be complete

This proposal is still in developing, for more details, please refer to [Tracking issue for GSP-134: Write Behavior Consistency](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage/issues/624).

### GSP-139: Split Specs

[GSP-139](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage/blob/master/docs/rfcs/139-split-specs.md) intends to split [specs](https://github.com/beyondstorage/specs) into different repos, to fit the new model of community permission.

It has now been implemented by [cmd: Move definitions here as described in GSP-139](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage/pull/652) and [docs: Move rfcs and spec here as required in GSP-139](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage/pull/628).

For more details, please refer to [Tracking issue for GSP-139: Split Specs](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage/issues/627).

## 库

### Deprecated Fields and Packages

With the updating of [go-storage][], some fields and packages are marked **deprecated** in last several versions.

After a few updating, we decided to remove them, which has already been implemented by [@JinnyYi][].

For more details, please refer to [Remove deprecated fields](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage/pull/619) and [Remove deprecated package pkg/endpoint](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage/pull/621).

### New Repo: setup-hdfs

To make test in GitHub action more convenient, [@Xuanwo][] created this new repo: [setup-hdfs](https://github.com/beyondstorage/setup-hdfs).

You can easily set up Apache Hadoop/HDFS in GitHub Action workflows by introducing this, like:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/setup-python@v2
    with:
      python-version: '3.8'
  - uses: actions/setup-java@v1
    with:
      java-version: '11'

  - uses: beyondstorage/setup-hdfs@master
    with:
      hdfs-version: '3.3.1'

  - run: curl ${namenode-addr}
```

This is also available on [GitHub marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-apache-hdfs) now.

### Add uint64 Support in definitions

We generate codes in `cmd/definition` in [go-storage][]. In type map, we defined the transfer of different types, which is lack of `uint64`. In type map, we defined the transfer of different types, which is lack of `uint64`.

So [@zu1k][] submitted a PR: [definitions: Add support for type uint64](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage/pull/615) to fix this. Nicely done! Nicely done!

### Add codecov

[Codecov](https://codecov.io) is a tool to ensure our code quality by checking the code coverage by tests.

[@Xuanwo][] introduced it to increase the test coverage as tracked in issue: [Increase code coverage](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage/issues/620).

For more details, please refer to [ci: Add codecov in unittests](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage/pull/622).

## 社区

### Forum UI Design

We use <https://forum.beyondstorage.io> as our forum, and now our new forum theme UI is in designing!

The draft is [here](https://www.figma.com/file/AqHxMvbAccGQM5NtvQEGCn/BeyondStorage.io?node-id=23%3A0), please feel free to submit your opinion.
